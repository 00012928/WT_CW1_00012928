Web Technology Coursework by 00012928

The website was created by WIUT student 00012928 to fulfill the requirements of the Web Technology module.
The company "Travel Agency" is an imaginary company and does not represent any actual name or service. There was not any existing website similar to the current one, and it was developed from scratch. However, in some parts of the website, Youtube tutorials were watched and observed by me in order to create better design and user interactivity. There are a total of six pages with unique names, namely Homepage, About Us, Destinations, Prices, Register, and Contact Us. They are all connected to each other, and users may easily access any page.

Creating a website was really challenging for me, especially in terms of designing and making it responsive to different screen resolutions and widths. All seminar materials and online sources helped me develop my website professionally. One of the most difficult times for me was when I needed to create a responsive and simple header and footer. Moreover, it took a long time to create a variety of pages since each contained a different design and contents.

In general, developing my first website was a really amazing journey, and it was challenging as well since it included working with different programming languages. Last but not least, in the future, I will do my best to create even better websites.
